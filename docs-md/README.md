big-toolbox / [Exports](modules.md)

# big-toolbox

Library of common TypeScript utilities as a package. It's really a grab-bag of different functions and types that I've written over time. I wouldn't use this
as a browser library, but instead is intended for use with a bundler of some sorts so that tree-shaking can be performed.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save big-toolbox
yarn add big-toolbox
```

## Constribution

Feel free to contribute new functionality to this library by issuing a PR.
